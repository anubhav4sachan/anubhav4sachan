# Anubhav Sachan â€”@anubhav4sachan
Hi there, I'm Anubhav â€” a final year undergrad at National Institute of Technology Silchar. 

I have worked in the quite interesting fields of Multi Agent Reinforcement Learning (in Dialogue Systems), Generative Adversarial Networks, Representational Learning, Pattern Recognition in Biometrics (Pore-based Fingerprint Recognition System) and Debunking Fake News.

I have developed a research interest focussing on the fundamentals of state-action space and rewards' system in Reinforcement Learning and would love to talk about it.

My interests range from academic topics like, Reinforcement Learning, Computational Liguistics, AI Interpretability, Advanced Neural Networks to non-academic including and not limited to Photography, (Re) tweeting the latest technological updates, and playing Chess (unrated, leisure only!).
