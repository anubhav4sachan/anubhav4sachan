# Anubhav Sachan â€”@anubhav4sachan
Hi there, I'm Anubhav â€” a final year undergrad at National Institute of Technology Silchar. 

I have worked in the quite interesting fields of Multi Agent Reinforcement Learning (in Dialogue Systems), Generative Adversarial Networks, Representational Learning, Pattern Recognition in Biometrics (Pore-based Fingerprint Recognition System) and Debunking Fake News.

My interests range from academic topics like, Reinforcement Learning, Computational Liguistics, AI Interpretability, Advanced Neural Networks to non-academic including and not limited to Photography, (Re) tweeting the latest technological updates, and playing Chess (unrated, leisure only!).
